# KickStart Solutions

Solution scripts for past Google Kickstart rounds that I did for practice

There are helper scripts to manage problems:

* `clean.sh` : removes all `*.txt` or compiled binaries

* `compile.sh`: ```compile.sh plates_incomplete.cpp``` will compile plates_incomplete.cpp to plates binary for testing

* `complete.sh`: ```complete.sh plates_incomplete.cpp``` will rename plates_incomplete.cpp to plates.cpp indicating that the problem has now been solved.

* `create.sh`: ```create.sh plates``` will create the file plates_incomplete.cpp and initilize it with template.cpp.
